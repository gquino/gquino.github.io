I am involved with teaching of 3 modules at the [Engineering Science Department](https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/) of the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). 

## B8 Materials

In this module, students learn about 4 of the most relevant materials in engineering design: metals, ceramics, polymers and composites.

## B5 Solid Mechanics
In this module students study elasticity. In particular, I have led the practical demonstration and implemented the section of analysis of strains with digital image correlation analysis, used since 2016.

## BX Introduction to FEM
In the laboratory session students are given a design problem that they have to solve using the FEA module of SolidWorks.

## P5 Design
In the laboratory session students learn the basics of engineering drawing standards using Solidworks.
